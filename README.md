## Description

A very simple SPA application for showing places for diving. These places are usually known just to local people, my idea is to create a collection point, where everyone can find the places near them and also add new ones.

## Used APIs

- [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get information about weather at locations of JumPoint
- [Mapy.cz API](https://api.mapy.cz/) to show the JumPoints on the map
- Custom API with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to add a new JumPoint

## Used Technologies

- React.js - frontend
- Python - backend
- MongoDB - database
