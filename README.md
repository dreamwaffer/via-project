## Description

A very simple SPA application for showing places for diving. These places are usually known just to local people, my idea is to create a collection point, where everyone can find the places near them and also add new ones.

## Used APIs

- [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get information about weather at locations of JumPoint
- [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/) to show the JumPoints on the map. I used [reactJS library](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- Custom API with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) to add a new JumPoint

## Used Technologies

- ReactJS - frontend
- Java Spring - backend
- PostgreSQL - database
